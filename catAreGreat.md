# We All LOVE Cats

Use the provided start_point and complete the following tasks:

1. Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
2. Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat, just like we did with the quotes.
3. Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. Why not put the cat data into an array, suggestive question mark?

## EXTENSION:
 - practice using CSS to make things look "nice"!

_Hint:_ Be careful with the order you append your elements to each other!
Also be careful with what you need to pass when setting an image's width via the DOM.
Remember: cats are GREAT !
